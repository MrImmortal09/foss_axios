Hi, Rushil here.
My roll no. is LIT2024012.

Fun Fact:A little coding fun fact: The first computer bug was an actual bug! In 1947, computer
scientists found a moth trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer, causing a malfunction. They
literally "debugged" the machine by removing the insect, and that’s how the term “bug” in programming
was born!
